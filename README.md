# final-test

This was the assigned final project for an intro to data structures course.   The application randomly selects a set of questions from a question bank.  The student answers the questions and the program uses simple <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fuzzy-logic">fuzzy logic</a>, if necessary, to approximate whether the input matches the correct answer.  The student can either elect to redo the test or save the results to a date and time stamped text file.
